## Data Processing 

## Missing Data 
MCAR: missing completely at random 
  - the prob of an observation mission does not depend on observed or unobserved measurements
MAR: missing at random
  - given the observed data, the prob that data is missing does not depend on the unobserved data
  
Some ways to deal with missing data:
- remove rows containing missing data
- replace missing entries with a substitute variable
- estimate a probability model for the missing variable and replace the missing values with samples from the probability model
